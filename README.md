# FAKKU Enhanced

**FAKKU Enhanced** is a userscript for improving the browsing experience on [FAKKU](https://www.fakku.net).

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).
2. **[Install the script by clicking here.](https://github.com/Daiz/fakku-enhanced/raw/stable/fakku-enhanced.user.js)**

## Features

- Sorts tags so that followed tags are always listed first, while common tags *(hentai, uncensored, subscription, doujin, book)* are always listed last.
- Adds highlights for followed artists, magazines and publishers (you will need to visit your [Following](https://www.fakku.net/account/following) page to initialize this, as the script can't know the followed status of non-tag attributes from listings alone).
- Moves collection/chapter listing above comments.
