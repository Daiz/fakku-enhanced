# FAKKU Experiments

**FAKKU Experiments** is a userscript for experimental frontend features on [FAKKU](https://www.fakku.net).

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).
2. **[Install the script by clicking here.](https://github.com/Daiz/fakku-enhanced/raw/stable/fakku-enhanced.user.js)**

## Available Experiments

- Sort tags so that followed tags are always listed first, while category tags are always listed last.
- Add highlights for followed artists, magazines and publishers. **You will need to visit your [Following](https://www.fakku.net/account/following) page to initialize this, as the script can't know the followed status of non-tag attributes from listings alone.**
- Move collection/chapter listing above comments.

## Tag Groups

Currently there is only tag group, which is called the "category" tags. In the future this will likely be replaced with full-blown tag groups, but for now, this moves the various format descriptions to the back while bringing the actual content tags to the front.

- **category:** hentai, ecchi, non-h, anime, illustration, spread, interview, western, uncensored, censored, subscription, doujin, book, dubbed, subbed

## Why Userscript?

Userscript gives me full freedom to do whatever I want however I want and whenever I want, and it's primary purpose is to test and develop feature proposals for the site proper. I also have a soft spot for userscripts in general considering my whole career basically got started by editing and developing userscripts!
